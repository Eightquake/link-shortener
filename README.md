# link-shortener
#### Semi-private repo for Victor Davidsson
---

The scripts and handler for my link shortener. While this is a public repo, it is more intended to be used as a source of ideas rather than code to be executed. I have obfuscated some things in secret.json so don't expect this to work right out of the box.
This has mostly been a project for me to learn some new stuff, I tried to simulate what a workgroup of multiple people might use - like JSDoc and JSHint. I wanted to make it public so that I can easily show the code during work interviews.
All links and mentions to the actual product have been hidden.

Contact me at [kontakt@victordavidsson.se](mailto:kontakt@victordavidsson.se) for any questions.
